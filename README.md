## Overview

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- View an age in years, months, and days after submitting a valid date through the form
- Receive validation errors if:
  - Any field is empty when the form is submitted
  - The day number is not between 1-31
  - The month number is not between 1-12
  - The year is in the future
  - The date is invalid e.g. 31/04/1991 (there are 30 days in April)
- View the optimal layout for the interface depending on their device's screen size
- See hover and focus states for all interactive elements on the page
- **Bonus**: See the age numbers animate to their final number when the form is submitted

- Arithmetic between two dates values in javaSript
- Refire css animation with javaScript after a previous one is completed

- JavaScript
- Nodejs

### Useful resources

- [JavaScript validation of number of days in a given month](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/1433030/validate-number-of-days-in-a-given-month#answer-1433119) - This helped me validated number of days in a given month. For example february has 28 or 29 days per month.
- [Arithmetic between two dates values in javaScript](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/17732897/difference-between-two-dates-in-years-months-days-in-javascript#answer-49201872) - It let's calculate how many years, month and days are between two dates.
- [Refire css animation with javaScript after a previous one is completed](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/35200605/refire-css-animation-with-javascript-after-a-previous-one-is-complete#answer-35203145) - It let's initiate animation many times after a previous one is completed.
